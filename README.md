# mocha-es6-typescript-example

This is a pared down version of [jgdonas's mocha-tests-w-typescript-w-es6-imports-working-example](https://github.com/jgdonas/mocha-tests-w-typescript-w-es6-imports-working-example) except removing everything not essential to running tests (vue and electron)

Primarily I was interested in the package.json

- dependencies
- test script

## Unsolicited Personal Opinion

This is a giant pain in the butt to have so many extra and convoluted dependencies to use es6 and typescript and do unit testing - each of which is a pretty much default requirement for any typical modern day project. Really? Seriously? This is 2021, right?

## To run

- yarn install
- yarn test
